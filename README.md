# Stock Market Based Question & Answer System 

This project is based on LLM. This program fetches stock related urls (today or from two days ago) from Moneycontrol website using webscraping. Then fetched urls are provided to the langchain NewsURLLoader function to extract data from that. This data is then provided to the QnA System (LLM model) where users can retrieve information on the stock market by asking stock related query.
