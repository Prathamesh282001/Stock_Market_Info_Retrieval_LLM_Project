      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world as we know it. From self-driving cars to facial recognition software, AI is already having a major impact on our lives. And it's only going to become more prevalent in the years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what is AI? And how is it going to change our world?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of AI, discuss some of its potential applications, and take a look at some of the challenges that lie ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is the ability of a machine to simulate human intelligence. This includes the ability to learn, reason, and solve problems. AI is often used to automate tasks that would otherwise be done by humans, such as customer service, data analysis, and medical diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How is AI going to change our world?\n",
      "\n",
      "AI has the potential to change our world in a number of ways. Here are a few examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **AI-powered machines could automate tasks that are currently done by humans, freeing up our time for more creative and fulfilling activities.**\n",
      "* **AI could help us to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change and poverty.**\n",
      "* **AI could make our lives more convenient and enjoyable, by providing us with personalized services and experiences.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are also some potential challenges associated with AI. For example, AI could be used to create autonomous weapons systems that could kill without human intervention. AI could also be used to create surveillance systems that could track our every move.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to be aware of the potential risks of AI, but it's also important to remember that AI has the potential to make our world a better place.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Some of the potential applications of AI include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Self-driving cars**. AI-powered cars could make our roads safer and more efficient.\n",
      "* **Facial recognition software**. AI could be used to identify criminals and prevent fraud.\n",
      "* **Medical diagnosis**. AI could help doctors to diagnose diseases more quickly and accurately.\n",
      "* **Customer service**. AI could be used to provide customer service 24/7.\n",
      "* **Data analysis**. AI could be used to analyze large amounts of data and identify trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The challenges of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of challenges associated with AI, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The potential for bias**. AI systems can be biased against certain groups of people, such as women and minorities.\n",
      "* **The potential for job loss**. AI-powered machines could automate tasks that are currently done by humans, leading to job losses.\n",
      "* **The potential for security breaches**. AI systems could be hacked, which could lead to data breaches and other problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to be aware of these challenges and to take steps to mitigate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is a powerful technology with the potential to change our world in a number of ways. It's important to be aware of the potential benefits and risks of AI, and to use it wisely.\n",
      "\n",

The bank is well poised to report further improvement in operating performance as all key vectors (credit cost, margins & opex) continue to move in the right direction, unlike for most other banks. The steady loan growth (of 19% CAGR over FY24-26E) and a more favorable asset mix toward retail will continue to support margins, especially with the shift in the interest rate cycle. The bank aims to improve upon its CASA mix to >45%, while increasing the mix of retail deposits to 45-50% of the overall deposits. Asset quality ratios have improved, while continued moderation in slippages, dissolution of restructured assets (have declined to 0.5% vs peak of 3.6% in 2QFY22), and contingency buffer of 0.5% of loans provide further comfort. IIB is well capitalized with CET-1 of 16.3% and any further capital infusion by promoters to increase the stake in the bank would further aid capitalization levels.

Even so, the path to taming inflation will be bumpy, as a measure of consumer prices rose by the most in three months.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nSimilar metrics in Norway and Chile eased in December, while Argentina ended the year with inflation above 200%. While inflation is mostly retreating around the world, soaring shipping costs and a jump in oil prices are stoking worries about a revival of cost pressures.\\n\\nHere are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:\\n\\nWorld\\n\\nAfter racing ahead with the most aggressive tightening campaign in decades during 2022 and 2023, central banks around the world are poised to begin easing monetary policy as inflation continues to retreat. The shift is captured by Bloomberg Economics, whose aggregate gauge of rates across the world shows a decline of 128 basis points over the year, mostly led by emerging economies. Poland, Serbia and Korea held rates steady this past week, while Peru cut.\\n\\nOnly days into a 2024 that was meant to be the year inflation dissipated, manufacturers and retailers are again juggling delays and facing higher expenses as persistent attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea rattle a major shipping route through the Suez Canal. Ocean freight rates for goods from Asia to Europe have more than doubled over the past four weeks.\\n\\nOver the next several weeks, governments from the US, UK and the eurozone will start flooding the market with bonds at a clip rarely seen before. Saddled with the kind of bloated deficits that were once unthinkable, these countries — along with Japan — will sell a net $2.1 trillion of new bonds to finance their 2024 spending plans, a 7% increase from last year, according to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nWar over Taiwan would have a cost in blood and treasure so vast that even those unhappiest with the status quo have reason not to risk it. Bloomberg Economics estimate the price tag at around $10 trillion, equal to about 10% of global GDP — dwarfing the blow from the war in Ukraine, Covid pandemic and Global Financial Crisis.\\n\\nAn annual poll conducted by the World Economic Forum — ahead of its global summit in Davos this week — put “misinformation and disinformation” at the top of threats facing the global economy in the short term. The report confronts how economies squeezed by high borrowing costs after a once-in-a generation inflation shock just as major elections take place could present a toxic backdrop for the world in coming months.\\n\\nUS\\n\\nUS inflation accelerated at the end of 2023, fueled by stubborn services costs while a protracted decline in goods prices petered out. Much of the surprise in so-called core goods, which excludes energy and food, came from pickups in prices for used cars and apparel, despite year-end promotional activity.\\n\\nPrices paid to US producers extended their retreat in December, prompting traders to increase bets on how aggressively the Fed will cut interest rates this year. Categories within the PPI that feed directly into the calculation for the Fed’s preferred inflation metric were mostly soft.\\n\\nWith its large White and rural population, evangelical voters and mix of factories and farms, Iowa — which on Monday will host the first contest in the race for the Republican presidential nomination — is hardly representative of the national electorate.

The index hit a lifetime high of 21,928, ending the week up 0.85 percent.\\n\\nIn the previous weekly edition, we said that the index could still rise towards 22,000 and this was resistance formed by the placement of the uptrend line. Thus, Nifty managed to break above the support of 21,500 and tested almost 22,000 in futures.

On January 10, 2024, it took out the said range, thus making it lucrative at current levels.\\n\\nOn the indicator front, the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has given a bullish cross exactly above the zero line, which is a sign of further bullishness in the counter. Thus, one can buy in the range of Rs 1,175–1,200 with an upside target of Rs 1,350 and a stop-loss of Rs 1,099 on a daily close basis.\\n\\nYes Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 24.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 21 | Target: Rs 31 | Return: 24.5 percent\\n\\nRecently the said counter has given a clean breakout on the weekly time frame chart along with Stochastics reversing from 70 zone which is looking lucrative at current levels.

A similar facility of voluntary blocking/ freezing of demat accounts is already available for investors and this facility would now be offered to the investors for their trading accounts also.\\n\\n”To enhance ease of doing business and ease of investment, it has been decided that the framework for trading members to provide the facility of voluntary freezing/blocking the online access of the trading account to their clients on account of suspicious activities shall be laid down on or before April 1, 2024, by the ISF,” Sebi said. Further, the regulator asked stock exchanges to ensure that the guidelines issued under the framework are implemented by trading members from July 1, 2024.\\n\\nIn a separate circular, Sebi asked stock exchanges to put in place a mechanism for monitoring clients’ funds lying with the stock brokers. This will be based on the principle that the total available funds — cash and cash equivalent — with the stock broker and with the clearing corporation/clearing member should always be equal to or greater than clients’ funds as per the ledger balance.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nThis came after Sebi received representations from various stakeholders citing inefficiencies due to duplication of monitoring mechanisms and difficulties in uploading data to exchanges.', metadata={'title': 'Sebi mulls framework for voluntary blocking of trading accounts by clients', 'link': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-mulls-framework-for-voluntary-blocking-of-trading-accounts-by-clients-12045181.html', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'SEBI announces framework by April 1, enabling trading members to voluntarily block online access for clients with suspicious activities.', 'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 13, 10, 10, 52, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, 19800))}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Binance's split from WazirX in 2022 seemed advantageous, but a government crackdown on offshore platforms has shifted dynamics, impacting the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in the Indian market.\\n\\nWhen Binance Holdings Ltd. acrimoniously split with its Indian affiliate WazirX in 2022, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange looked near-invincible in the local market while WazirX was flailing. A government crackdown on offshore platforms has abruptly reversed the competitive dynamics.\\n\\nSince Indian authorities in late December began restricting access to Binance and other foreign crypto exchanges operating there without local registrations, traders have flocked to domestic rivals like WazirX. Many of them are moving deposits across from Binance, according to the local venues.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nIt’s a welcome reprieve for WazirX and competitors like CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber, which were pummeled by a 2022 taxation regime that drove traders to offshore exchanges. They appear poised for further gains after Apple Inc.’s App Store this week took down the apps of Binance and seven other foreign exchanges after a request from India’s government.\\n\\nDeposit inflows at WazirX jumped about 250% in the four days following India’s Dec. 28 compliance show-cause notice to nine offshore platforms, compared with the four days leading up to it, according to the company. CoinDCX reopened for deposits right after the event and they immediately began pouring in, CEO Sumit Gupta said.\\n\\n“The figures we usually do in 3 months, we’ve been able to realize those in the past two weeks,” Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Y Combinator-backed platform Mudrex, said about deposit inflows and new users. More than 30,000 customers have registered on Mudrex since Dec. 28, he added.\\n\\nWazirX and Mudrex estimated that roughly 70% of their fresh inflows came from Binance, while CoinDCX put the figure at around 40%.\\n\\nBinance said it’s “working hard to inform constructive policy-making that seeks to benefit every user and all market participants,” repeating a statement it made after the App Store removal. It didn’t respond to questions on deposit outflows.\\n\\nEstimates for market share among exchanges catering to crypto traders in India aren’t available. But judging by app downloads, Binance has been dominant in the market since a transaction tax introduced in mid-2022 ruined the economics of frequent trading on local platforms. CoinDCX’s Gupta has estimated that the levy drove some 95% of Indian trading to offshore venues that didn’t collect it.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nIndia’s government moved against offshore exchanges after months of lobbying by local competitors who argued that fresh taxes unveiled in 2022 created an unfair playing field. The late-December notice from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit said the nine exchanges are operating illegally in India without complying with anti-money laundering provisions introduced last year, inviting them to explain how they are in compliance.\\n\\nThe FIU also asked the information ministry to block the nine platforms’ websites locally. On Friday evening, their URLs were not working in India. Their apps are still available on Google Play in India.\\n\\nThe picture is more nuanced when it comes to trading volumes, which the Tax Deducted at Source that took effect in 2022 almost wiped out.\\n\\nWazirX said volumes haven’t budged much, while CoinDCX said the slight uptick it’s noticed in the past two weeks may be more due to overall bullish crypto sentiment. CoinSwitch, however, said trading volumes on its platform jumped 30-35% in the week following the FIU notice to offshore rivals. Like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch reopened for deposits after the FIU action.\\n\\nChina Tensions\\n\\nEsya Centre, a New Delhi-based think tank, wrote to India’s Ministry of Home Affairs in late October arguing for restrictions to be put on offshore crypto exchanges that don’t abide by anti-money laundering regulations. It pointed out that seven of those platforms have Chinese origins or founders, according to a copy of the letter seen by Bloomberg. Esya Centre declined to comment.\\n\\nBinance was founded in China by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian citizen.\\n\\nAlluding to China, India’s main geopolitical rival in Asia, may have touched a nerve.\\n\\nIn 2020, India banned 59 Chinese apps including TikTok amid border tensions then in the Himalayas. It banished another 232 Chinese apps last year in a sign that relations remain fraught between the two nations.\\n\\n“The current developments too are reflective of India’s ongoing scrutiny of incoming Chinese investments and the operation of Chinese companies within the country,” Sana Hashmi, a visiting fellow at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation who focuses on the foreign relations of India, China and Taiwan, said about the clampdown on offshore crypto exchanges.\", metadata={'title': 'Binance loses Indian traders to domestic rivals like WazirX', 'link': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/binance-loses-indian-traders-to-domestic-rivals-like-wazirx-12045121.html', 'authors': ['Angana Pal Chinya'], 'language': 'en', 'description': \"Binance's split from WazirX in 2022 seemed advantageous, but a government crackdown on offshore platforms has shifted dynamics, impacting the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in the Indian market.\", 'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 13, 9, 48, 23, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, 19800))}),\n",
